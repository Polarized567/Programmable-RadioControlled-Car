# Programmable-RadioControlled-Car

Please note that this is an unreleased work. 
When opening the project:
1. Download the zip file.
2. Unzip the download.
3. Open the file in Arduino Uno Desktop or another code reader.
4. Navigate into the Arduino-Car Folder.
5. The AsyncTCP and EsPAsyncWebServer are both essential libraries needed when programming code and uploading it to the project using Arduino Uno.
6. Navigate into the CameraCar-main(1) folder.
7. Naviagte into the Camera_Car foler.
8. The Camera_Car.ino is the file that contains the code used to program the project.

This work is currently what has been able to be uploaded into Github and highlights what has been done. From this code being uploaded through Arduino Uno into the ESP32 Cam, this car is able to be radio controlled through the average smartphone using the car's own WiFi signal. 
As time progresses, further changes are being added to the project that will allow it to use image recognition through programs such as OpenCV, this will have a large impact on the local and the larger community, especially amongst the less mobile.

Thank You
